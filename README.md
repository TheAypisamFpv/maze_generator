# Maze Generator

This is a Python-based maze generator that generates random mazes.

## How it works

The maze generator algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to create a maze. It starts with a grid of cells and randomly selects a cell to visit. It then carves a path through the maze by removing walls between adjacent cells. The process continues until all cells have been visited.


## Customization

You can customize the maze generation process by modifying the parameters in the `maze_generator.py` script. For example, you can adjust the size of the maze, the starting point, or the algorithm used for generating the maze.
